# DiscordBot

This is a discord bot I made on C# for studying. So far it contains some functions like !random quote, which gives you a random quote, and !calc which is a calculator that can even calculate expressions like ((5 + 7) * 2)/7 ^ 2 + 2 * 10,5 and it will solve it respecting the order of signals
